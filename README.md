# About the website
* This is the github repository for the website we have created for HRL.
* We are using GitHub pages for free hosting and bought our domain name from [Google Domains](https://domains.google/).
* Our front end aesthetic was inspired by Luke Smith ([The War of Web Bloat Continues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY70NCW98Is)) ... so use of JS is kept to a minimum.   
* Join HRL to be liberated from web peasantry ([Don't be a Web Peasant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdKZVIGRAKQ)) as we together own this modicum of ~~the means of production~~ the internet.  
* Feel free to le tus know about suggestions or spelling errors in the text...HTML doesn't spell check itself (though there's probably a VSCode extension we could install to do that).
